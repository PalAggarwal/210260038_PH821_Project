# 210260038_PH821_Project

In this project, we have estimated component masses and sky location of a binary GW source. 

There are three code files - 
1. 210260038_code_Part1.ipynb - This is has initial data analysis, specifically finding event time using matched filtering and plotting the PSD.
2. 210260038_code_Part2_PE.py - This is a python script used for parameter estimation. This returns 'posterior.csv' which has the posterior distribution of parameters.
3. 210260038_code_Part3_results.ipynb - This notebook has the parameters estimated from the posterior distribution and the corresponding histograms and corner plots.

The 'posterior.csv' file obtained and used for the project has also been uploaded to this respository along with the project report.
